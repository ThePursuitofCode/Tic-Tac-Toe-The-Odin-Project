// Goal have as little global code as possible!

// Rule: If you need ONE of something (gameBoard, displayController) use a module.
// Rule: If you need TWO+ of something (players), create them with factories.

const gameBoard= (() = >{
    
})

// Create a factory function object for the players

// Create a factory function to control the flow of the game.

// Create a function that allows players to add marks to a specific spot on the board. Don't allow players to play in spots already taken.

// Build logic that checks if the game is over. Should check if 3 in a row and a tie. Display who the winner is on screen.

// Add buttons for starting and restarting the game.

// (Optional)
// Build an AI so players can play against the computer.
// - After player starts, AI chooses a random legal move.
// - Possible to make an unbeatable AI by using the minimax algorithm.
